Which measurable factors play a significant role in the outcome of a football game that could be attributed to the idea of "home-field advantage"? 

This project is an example of manipulating raw data into tangible evidence.  This is done to either support or refute our initial question regarding home-field advantage. Moreover, are there any other factors surrounding a football game that can be measured to show a significant influence over the gameâ€™s outcome? Every part of the project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

*Importing pandas, matplotlib, and other necessary dependencies be begin

*Importing and merging CSV files with proper path configuration

*Cleaning data to remove null values to improve the quality of the data set

*Merging data frames and columns within data frames to prevent overlap

*Uitilzing pandas to create data frames 

*Plotting pie graphs from data frames

*Plotting bar graphs from data frames

*Plotting scatter plots from data frames


The home team wins 57% of the games played since 1966. They have a higher winning percentage in both the regular season and the playoffs. The home team also has a higher winning percentage in moderate and cold temperatures, as well as on grass fields and in outdoor stadiums. There is a negative correlation between windspeed and total average score, and a minimal correlation between temperature and average points scored. The sample code allowed our group to come to these conclusions, given the limits of the chosen data.
